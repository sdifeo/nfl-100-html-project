            <h2 class="title">The Helmet catch</h2>
            <p class="description">Within the last two minutes of Super Bowl XLII on February 3, 2008 Eli Manning escapes the grasp of three New England Patriots defensive players to throw an impressive ball down the field for 32 yards.
                What was more impressive was the catch itself. David Tyree, making a spectacular catch with his helmet, his catch allowed his team to win the Super Bowl 17-14.

            <h2 class="title">The Immaculate catch</h2>
            <p class="description">The Immaculate Reception is one of the most famous plays in the history of American football. It is considered one of the most controversial plays in the NFL.
                With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game, Pittsburgh quarterback Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua. The ball either bounced off the helmet of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua, and, as it fell, Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game-winning touchdown.

            <h2 class="title">The Beast Quake</h2>
            <p class="description">The play occurred in the fourth quarter, when Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch broke nine tackles during the course of a 67-yard touchdown run that ultimately provided the winning margin. 
                The play's name comes from Lynch's nickname, "Beast Mode", and the fact that, during and after the play, movement from Seattle fans jumping in celebration was so intense that it registered on a nearby seismograph.
